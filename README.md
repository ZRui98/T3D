# T3D: Pseudo 3D Tower Defense

A pseudo 3d game where a player navigates a square tile based map placing down towers to stop waves of enemies from attacking a square objective tile. This repository contains source code & resources for a game that I had worked on in late 2015-early 2016 for an ISU. Goals of this project was to use object oriented programming to create a functioning program. I am no longer working on this project.

# Issues
Problems with accurate projectile angles due to int casted x, y movements. Sprites rendered slightly inaccurate due to estimates done on angles.

# Resources 
Raycasting procedure & formulas - http://permadi.com/tutorial/raycast/rayc1.html
